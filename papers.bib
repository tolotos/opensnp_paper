  abstract = {Rapid advances in DNA sequencing promise to enable new diagnostics
	and individualized therapies. Achieving personalized medicine, however,
	will require extensive research on highly reidentifiable, integrated
	datasets of genomic and health information. To assist with this,
	participants in the Personal Genome Project choose to forgo privacy
	via our institutional review board- approved “open consent” process.
	The contribution of public data and samples facilitates both scientific
	discovery and standardization of methods. We present our findings
	after enrollment of more than 1,800 participants, including whole-genome
	sequencing of 10 pilot participant genomes (the PGP-10). We introduce
	the Genome-Environment-Trait Evidence (GET-Evidence) system. This
	tool automatically processes genomes and prioritizes both published
	and novel variants for interpretation. In the process of reviewing
	the presumed healthy PGP-10 genomes, we find numerous literature
	references implying serious disease. Although it is sometimes impossible
	to rule out a late-onset effect, stringent evidence requirements
	can address the high rate of incidental findings. To that end we
	develop a peer production system for recording and organizing variant
	evaluations according to standard evidence guidelines, creating a
	public forum for reaching consensus on interpretation of clinically
	relevant variants. Genome analysis becomes a two-step process: using
	a prioritized list to record variant evaluations, then automatically
	sorting reviewed variants using these annotations. Genome data, health
	and trait information, participant samples, and variant interpretations
	are all shared in the public domain—we invite others to review
	our results using our participant samples and contribute to our interpretations.
	We offer our public resource and methods to further personalized
	medical research.},

	(PLM), for research in multiple sclerosis (MS). An investigation
	of the role of body mass index (BMI) on MS disease course was conducted
	to illustrate the utility of the platform.First, we compared the
	demographic characteristics of subjects from PLM and from a regional
	MS center. Second, we validated PLM's patient-reported outcome measure
	(MS Rating Scale, MSRS) against standard physician-rated tools. Finally,
	we analyzed the relation of BMI to the MSRS measure.Compared with
	4,039 MS Center patients, the 10,255 PLM members were younger, more
	educated, and less often male and white. Disease course was more
	often relapsing remitting, with younger symptom onset and shorter
	disease duration. Differences were significant because of large sample
	sizes but small in absolute terms. MSRS scores for 121 MS Center
	patients revealed acceptable agreement between patient-derived and
	physician-derived composite scores (weighted kappa = 0.46). The Walking
	domain showed the highest weighted kappa (0.73) and correlation (rs
	= 0.86) between patient and physician scores. Additionally, there
	were good correlations between the patient-reported MSRS composite
	and walking scores and physician-derived measures: Expanded Disability
	Status Scale (composite rs = 0.61, walking rs = 0.74), Timed 25 Foot
	Walk (composite rs = 0.70, walking rs = 0.69), and Ambulation Index
	(composite rs = 0.81, walking rs = 0.84). Finally, using PLM data,
	we found a modest correlation between BMI and cross-sectional MSRS
	(rho = 0.17) and no association between BMI and disease course.The
	PLM population is comparable to a clinic population, and its patient-reported
	MSRS is correlated with existing clinical instruments. Thus, this
	online platform may provide a venue for MS investigations with unique
	strengths (frequent data collection, large sample sizes). To illustrate
	its applicability, we assessed the role of BMI in MS disease course
	but did not find a clinically meaningful role for BMI in this setting.},

	Scripps Genomic Health Initiative, we compared demographic, behavioral,
	and attitudinal characteristics of DTC genomic test consumers who
	shared their results with their physician or health care provider
	versus those who did not share. We also compared genomic risk estimates
	between the two groups. Of 2,024 individuals assessed at approximately
	6 months post testing, 540 individuals (26.5\%) reported sharing
	their results with their physician or health care provider. Those
	who shared were older (p < .001), had a higher income (p = .01),
	were more likely to be married (p = .005), and were more likely to
	identify with a religion (p = .004). As assessed prior to undergoing
	testing, sharers also reported higher levels of exercise (p = .003),
	lower fat intake (p = .02), fewer overall concerns about testing
	(p = .001), and fewer concerns related to the privacy of their genomic
	information (p = .03). The genomic disease risk estimates disclosed
	were not associated with sharing. Thus, in a DTC genomic testing
	context, physicians and other health care providers may be more likely
	to encounter patients who are more health conscious and have fewer
	concerns about the privacy of their genomic information. Genomic
	risk itself does not appear to be a primary determinant of sharing

	genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PD based on a single collection
	of individuals to date (3,426 cases and 29,624 controls). We discovered
	two novel, genome-wide significant associations with PD-rs6812193
	near SCARB2 (p = 7.6 × 10(-10), OR = 0.84) and rs11868035 near SREBF1/RAI1
	(p = 5.6 × 10(-8), OR = 0.85)-both replicated in an independent
	cohort. We also replicated 20 previously discovered genetic associations

	support for our novel study design. Relying on a recently proposed
	method based on genome-wide sharing estimates between distantly related
	individuals, we estimated the heritability of PD to be at least 0.27.
	Finally, using sparse regression techniques, we constructed predictive
	models that account for 6\%-7\% of the total variance in liability
	and that suggest the presence of true associations just beyond genome-wide
	significance, as confirmed through both internal and external cross-validation.
	These results indicate a substantial, but by no means total, contribution
	of genetics underlying susceptibility to both early-onset and late-onset
	PD, suggesting that, despite the novel associations discovered here

  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:The number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is
	growing rapidly leading to the discovery and replication of many
	new disease loci. Combining results from multiple GWAS datasets may
	potentially strengthen previous conclusions and suggest new disease
	loci, pathways or pleiotropic genes. However, no database or centralized
	resource currently exists that contains anywhere near the full scope
	of GWAS results.METHODS:We collected available results from 118 GWAS
	articles into a database of 56,411 significant SNP-phenotype associations
	and accompanying information, making this database freely available
	here. In doing so, we met and describe here a number of challenges
	to creating an open access database of GWAS results. Through preliminary
	analyses and characterization of available GWAS, we demonstrate the
	potential to gain new insights by querying a database across GWAS.RESULTS:Using
	a genomic bin-based density analysis to search for highly associated
	regions of the genome, positive control loci (e.g., MHC loci) were
	detected with high sensitivity. Likewise, an analysis of highly repeated
	SNPs across GWAS identified replicated loci (e.g., APOE, LPL). At
	the same time we identified novel, highly suggestive loci for a variety
	of traits that did not meet genome-wide significant thresholds in
	prior analyses, in some cases with strong support from the primary
	medical genetics literature (SLC16A7, CSMD1, OAS1), suggesting these
	genes merit further study. Additional adjustment for linkage disequilibrium
	within most regions with a high density of GWAS associations did
	not materially alter our findings. Having a centralized database
	with standardized gene annotation also allowed us to examine the
	representation of functional gene categories (gene ontologies) containing
	one or more associations among top GWAS results. Genes relating to
	cell adhesion functions were highly over-represented among significant
	associations (p < 4.6 x 10-14), a finding which was not perturbed
	by a sensitivity analysis.CONCLUSION:We provide access to a full
	gene-annotated GWAS database which could be used for further querying,
	analyses or integration with other genomic information. We make a
	number of general observations. Of reported associated SNPs, 40%
	lie within the boundaries of a RefSeq gene and 68% are within 60
	kb of one, indicating a bias toward gene-centricity in the findings.
	We found considerable heterogeneity in information available from
	GWAS suggesting the wider community could benefit from standardization
	and centralization of results reporting.},

	and rs1121980 and rs8050136 downstream, were associated with childhood
	and adulthood BMI, respectively, and the risk effects of rs6499640
	and rs1121980 increased as birth weight decreased. The best joint
	effect model for childhood and adulthood BMI contained 14 and 15
	SNPs each, with 11 in common, and the percentage of explained variance
	increased from 0.17% and 9.0*10<sup>−6</sup>% to 2.22% and 2.71%,
	respectively. In summary, this study evidenced the presence of long-term
	major effects of genes on obesity development, implicated in pathways
	related to neural development and cell metabolism, and different
	sets of genes associated with childhood and adulthood BMI, respectively.
	The gene effects can vary with age and be modified by prenatal development.
	The best joint effect model indicated that multiple variants with
	effects that are weak or absent alone can nevertheless jointly exert
	a large longitudinal effect on BMI.</p>},

  abstract = {<p>Like most complex phenotypes, exceptional longevity is thought
	to reflect a combined influence of environmental (e.g., lifestyle
	choices, where we live) and genetic factors. To explore the genetic
	contribution, we undertook a genome-wide association study of exceptional
	longevity in 801 centenarians (median age at death 104 years) and
	914 genetically matched healthy controls. Using these data, we built
	a genetic model that includes 281 single nucleotide polymorphisms
	(SNPs) and discriminated between cases and controls of the discovery
	set with 89% sensitivity and specificity, and with 58% specificity
	and 60% sensitivity in an independent cohort of 341 controls and
	253 genetically matched nonagenarians and centenarians (median age
	100 years). Consistent with the hypothesis that the genetic contribution
	is largest with the oldest ages, the sensitivity of the model increased
	in the independent cohort with older and older ages (71% to classify
	subjects with an age at death&gt;102 and 85% to classify subjects
	with an age at death&gt;105). For further validation, we applied
	the model to an additional, unmatched 60 centenarians (median age
	107 years) resulting in 78% sensitivity, and 2863 unmatched controls
	with 61% specificity. The 281 SNPs include the SNP rs2075650 in <italic>TOMM40/APOE</italic>
	that reached irrefutable genome wide significance (posterior probability
	of association = 1) and replicated in the independent cohort.
	Removal of this SNP from the model reduced the accuracy by only 1%.
	Further in-silico analysis suggests that 90% of centenarians can
	be grouped into clusters characterized by different “genetic signatures”
	of varying predictive values for exceptional longevity. The correlation
	between 3 signatures and 3 different life spans was replicated in
	the combined replication sets. The different signatures may help
	dissect this complex phenotype into sub-phenotypes of exceptional
	longevity.</p>},

  abstract = {PatientsLikeMe is an online quantitative personal research platform
	for patients with life-changing illnesses to share their experience
	using patient-reported outcomes, find other patients like them matched
	on demographic and clinical characteristics, and learn from the aggregated
	data reports of others to improve their outcomes. The goal of the
	website is to help patients answer the question: "Given my status,
	what is the best outcome I can hope to achieve, and how do I get
	there?"Using a cross-sectional online survey, we sought to describe
	the potential benefits of PatientsLikeMe in terms of treatment decisions,
	symptom management, clinical management, and outcomes.Almost 7,000
	members from six PatientsLikeMe communities (amyotrophic lateral
	sclerosis [ALS], Multiple Sclerosis [MS], Parkinson's Disease, human
	immunodeficiency virus [HIV], fibromyalgia, and mood disorders) were
	sent a survey invitation using an internal survey tool (PatientsLikeMe
	Lens).Complete responses were received from 1323 participants (19\%
	of invited members). Between-group demographics varied according
	to disease community. Users perceived the greatest benefit in learning
	about a symptom they had experienced; 72\% (952 of 1323) rated the
	site "moderately" or "very helpful." Patients also found the site
	helpful for understanding the side effects of their treatments (n
	= 757, 57\%). Nearly half of patients (n = 559, 42\%) agreed that
	the site had helped them find another patient who had helped them
	understand what it was like to take a specific treatment for their
	condition. More patients found the site helpful with decisions to
	start a medication (n = 496, 37\%) than to change a medication (n
	= 359, 27\%), change a dosage (n = 336, 25\%), or stop a medication
	(n = 290, 22\%). Almost all participants (n = 1,249, 94\%) were diagnosed
	when they joined the site. Most (n = 824, 62\%) experienced no change
	in their confidence in that diagnosis or had an increased level of
	confidence (n = 456, 34\%). Use of the site was associated with increasing
	levels of comfort in sharing personal health information among those
	who had initially been uncomfortable. Overall, 12\% of patients (n
	= 151 of 1320) changed their physician as a result of using the site;
	this figure was doubled in patients with fibromyalgia (21\%, n =
	33 of 150). Patients reported community-specific benefits: 41\% of
	HIV patients (n = 72 of 177) agreed they had reduced risky behaviors
	and 22\% of mood disorders patients (n = 31 of 141) agreed they needed
	less inpatient care as a result of using the site. Analysis of the
	Web access logs showed that participants who used more features of
	the site (eg, posted in the online forum) perceived greater benefit.We
	have established that members of the community reported a range of
	benefits, and that these may be related to the extent of site use.
	Third party validation and longitudinal evaluation is an important
	next step in continuing to evaluate the potential of online data-sharing
	platforms.},

  abstract = {<p>The HOGG1 gene catalyzes the excision of modified bases and removal
	of DNA damage adducts. It may play an important role in the prevention
	of carcinogenesis. Ser<sup>326</sup>Cys polymorphism localizes in
	exon 7 of the hOGG1 gene. It takes the form of an amino acid substitution,
	from serine to cysteine, in codon 326. Several epidemiological association
	studies have been conducted on this polymorphism and its relationship
	with the risk of prostate cancer. However, results have been conflicting.
	To resolve this conflict, we conducted a meta-analysis on the association
	between this polymorphism and prostate cancer, taking into account
	race, country, sources of controls, and smoking status. A total of
	nine studies covering 2779 cases and 3484 controls were included
	in the current meta-analysis. Although no significant association
	was found between hOGG1 Ser<sup>326</sup>Cys polymorphism and prostate
	cancer susceptibility in the pooled analysis, individuals with Ser/Cys+Cys/Cys
	genotypes were found to have greater risk of prostate cancer if they
	were also smokers (OR = 2.66, 95% CI = 1.58−4.47) rather
	than non-smokers (OR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.13−4.19), compared
	with those with Ser/Ser genotype. In conclusion, our meta-analysis
	demonstrates that hOGG1 Ser<sup>326</sup>Cys polymorphism is a risk
	factor for prostate cancer in smokers. Further studies are needed
	to confirm this relationship.</p>},
